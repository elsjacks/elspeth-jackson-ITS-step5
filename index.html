  <p>BJJ was created in Brazil by the Gracie family (Carlos, Oswaldo, Gastão Jr., George, and Hélio) in the early 20th century. It was adapted from Kodokan judo, brought to Brazil by Japanese judoka Mitsuyo Maeda. "Jiu-Jitsu" translates from Japanese to "gentle art" or "gentle technique". <br>
    The Brazilian martial art is a combat style that involves fighting on the ground and with grappling techniques that help you make your opponent submit to you. It is one of the most commonly used disciplines by some of the most esteemed mixed-martial arts fighters around the globe.<br>
    The principles behind the discipline are designed in a way to make the art form useful to those who have smaller body frames. The basic concept behind the art is to help people who are smaller learn how to take down bigger opponents using skill and technique rather than strength.
<br><br>
    Now whats the tragic truth? Here are some downsides to the art of BJJ:
    <ul>
      <li>You no longer will have functioning knees</li>
      <li>Your spare time will be taken up by training and you will constantly be asked if you're in a cult</li>
      <li>Your bank account will be drained by buying the coolest gis and rashies</li>
      <li>You will constantly find yourself beaten by some 16 year old</li>
  </ul>
